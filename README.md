Review: Your site functions as intended. I liked the color scheme with the background. Code was clean and easy to follow. The only things I did notice was the button for showing the favorites was a bit small and hard to see at first glance. You are also able to add the same pokemon more then once to the favorites, a check to see if its already in the storage should fix that. All in all a great looking and functioning site. Good Job.
